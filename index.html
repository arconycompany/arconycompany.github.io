Game Data Collection
Whenever you play our games, we collect data about all of your interactions with the game and with the other players inside the game via server log files. This information may be associated with your player ID, IP address or device ID for the purpose of providing you our Services and improving them. This data is stored on servers located in the United States and other countries.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in a sweepstakes or contest through our Services. If you participate, we will request certain personal information from you. Participation in these sweepstakes and contests is voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip or postal code).
We use this information to notify winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic or personalize the Services. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these sweepstakes or contests; that company is prohibited from using your users’ personal information for any other purpose.
Tracking Technologies
We and our marketing and outsourcing partners, affiliates or analytics service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts and tags to identify a user’s computer or device and to “remember” things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information, such as your user ID, for purposes such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations to your interests and making the Services easier to use. You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Services.
We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer or device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer or device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Services and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.
You may contact us at Arconycompany@gmail.com for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies for the delivery of more relevant advertising.
Mobile Analytics
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.
Third Party Services
Our Services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include Google Analytics and MobileAppTracking by Tune. Such third parties may use cookies, APIs and SDKs in our Services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf. The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information and IP address for the purpose of providing their services under their respective privacy policies. This Policy does not cover the use of tracking tools from third parties. We do not have access or control over these third parties.
